## Hi, I'm Balázs!

😺 A silly programmer coding more than 5 years now.

🔭 **I'm working on** my [minecraft bot](https://github.com/BBpezsgo/Bruh-MC-Bot), [programming language](https://github.com/BBpezsgo/Interpreter) and my [Unity game](https://github.com/BBpezsgo/Nothing-DOTS). I don't have much free time so thats it.

🌱 **I'm learning** Unity DOTS, compiler and processor architecture, algorithms and optimizations.

❤️ **I'm interested in** low-level programming, simulations, compilers, operating systems and networking.

🫠 **Maybe I need help** understanding how vtables work with multiple inheritance and how to get a debug adapter working for my language.

🔧 **Langauges and Tools:**
